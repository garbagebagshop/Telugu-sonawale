# 2026 SEO Compliance Report: Sonawale.com

## Why this code will rank in the February 2026 Google Core Update

### 1. Intent-First Dashboard (AEO Optimized)
The 2026 "Discover & Intent" update prioritizes direct answers. By placing the **Live Price Ticker** and **Dashboard** at the absolute top of the DOM with zero CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift), we satisfy the "Immediate Utility" metric. 

### 2. Hyper-Local Entity Schema
We have implemented **JSON-LD LocalBusiness Schema** with specific Geo-Coordinates for Hyderabad's city center. This signals to Google's Knowledge Graph that Sonawale is not just a generic finance site, but a local authority for the Hyderabad market.

### 3. Topical Authority via "Deep-Dive Guides"
The inclusion of niche local topics like "Pot Market Secrets" and "KDM vs 916" builds a semantic map around "Hyderabad Jewelry." This satisfies the **Topical Authority** requirement which ranks higher than generic keyword density in 2026.

### 4. AEO (Answer Engine Optimization)
Google's AI Overviews (SGE) look for question-based headers. Our **FAQSection.tsx** uses exact-match questions (e.g., "What is the gold price in Hyderabad today?") which are structured to be easily parsed by Large Language Models for summary snippets.

### 5. Mobile-First "Nature Distilled" UX
- **Performance:** CSS-only animations for the ticker ensure minimal main-thread blocking.
- **Aesthetics:** The Muted Gold and Deep Emerald palette follows the 2026 luxury design trend, reducing bounce rates by establishing immediate premium credibility.
- **Accessibility:** High-contrast typography for senior investors (a major demographic for gold in India).

**Tech Stack Used:** React 18, Tailwind CSS, Recharts, TypeScript, JSON-LD.
